# Makeblock Library v3.25

Arduino Library for Makeblock Electronic Modules

# Copyright notice

In makeblock's library, some of the modules are derived from other open source projects, and also part of some code is inspired by the algorithms of other individuals or organizations. We will retain the copyright of the original open source code.

Before I released version 3.0.0, I didn't review the source of some old code in the makeblock library. This made me make some obvious mistakes. Fortunately, some of our users pointed out the mistakes we made.

So I reviewed our code in 2018/05/16, and correct some copyright information.

These modules is derived from other open source projects:

- MeRGBLed
- MeHumitureSensor
- Me7SegmentDisplay
- MeOneWire
- MeStepper

and these modules is inspired by some projects:

- MeUSBHost

As an open source library, we respect all contributors to the open source community and thank you very much for everyone's supervision.

### How to use:

1. Download the source from the git https://codeload.github.com/Makeblock-official/Makeblock-Libraries/zip/master

2. In the Arduino IDE: "Sketch-> Include Library-> Add .ZIP Library-> select the downloaded file-> Open"

3. Click "File-> Examples". Here are some test programs in "MakeBlockDrive->"

4. Depending on the type of board you're using, you need to modify the header file to match.
   For example, if you're using a mCore. You should change `#include <MeOrion.h>` to `#include <MeMCore.h>`
   Corresponding boards and there header file are:

   Orion <-------->  MeOrion.h

   BaseBoard <---->  MeBaseBoard.h

   mCore <-------->  MeMCore.h

   Shield <------->  MeShield.h

   Auriga <------->  MeAuriga.h

   MegaPi <------->  MeMegaPi.h
