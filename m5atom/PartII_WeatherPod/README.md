This is the repository of our class project for ENGR-UH 1021J: Design & Innovation Summer 2021, taught by Instructor Matthew Karau.

We used an M5 Stack Atom Matrix to prototype a WeatherPod, a device which displays temperature.

The M5 modes can be activated via connecting to browser, at the IP 192.168.4.1

   Alternatively, the user chooses the modes by flipping the M5 left and right. The purple moving dot indicates the modes.
   The mode is selected when the user clicks on M5. To change mode, flip the M5 again (as in the video).

   The modes are - 

    i. Show Active temperature + Units
    ii. Show average of last 24 hours of temperature + Units
    iii. Show color scale of temperature range + current temperature as color
    iv. Show graph of temperature across a predefined range.
    v. Change units  
    vi. Switch Off
