## About
- Arduino MegaChess converted for use on the M5Stack ESP32 Development System.
- Project by Sergey Urusov - full details [here](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Sergey_Urusov/arduino-mega-chess-for-m5stack-7feafb)

<br />  

## M5Stack Performance
- Advantages of M5Stack platform are repeatability and solving power of ESP32. 
- In comparison with original project performance level grows up in about 15 times, and is 2000-5000 nodes per second, what lead up to 10 plyes depth of solving tree in hard situations, and more in easy positions.

## Controls
- Interface uses 3 buttons - left, choice, and right. 
- Left and right to choose move (highlighted with green frames), choice button to make move.
- Long press of choice button (more then half of second press and release) to open menu, or close menu and return to game mode.
