# Bitty Bot

Started working on code for ESP8266.
2 different sketches, they are not complete
1st lets you send commands to the BittyBot via a webpage or url (It does not serve the page)
send like this: http://192.168.4.1/?drive=11  Where 11 is a number to tell the robot what to do
what this demostrates is how an Android or IOS device might beable to send commands to the robot

2nd sketch serves a webpage, currently it has a fake "Voltage" reading, what this demostrates is how the BittyBot
might beable to display information.

The ultimate idea would be to combine the two sketch so the BittyBot could serve the website, and have control code sent to it
