Code for the Bitty Bot Rover.

## Installation

Must have the NewPing Library installed

## Usage

Bitty Bot will drive forward until something gets in it way - slowing down as it gets close to an object at aproxmately 2 inches it will then backup, turn to the left, and try to move forward again.

This is a testing branch and things are bound to change over time, PIN numbers may or may not be the same at the end of testing.
