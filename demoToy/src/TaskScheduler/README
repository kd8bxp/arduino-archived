Task Scheduler – cooperative multitasking for Arduino, ESPx, STM32 and other microcontrollers
Version 3.1.4 2020-02-22

If you find TaskScheduler useful for your Arduino project, please drop me an email: arkhipenko@hotmail.com
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW:
 A lightweight implementation of cooperative multitasking (task scheduling) supporting:
 1. Periodic task execution (with dynamic execution period in milliseconds or microseconds)
 2. Number of iterations (n times)
 3. Execution of tasks in predefined sequence
 4. Dynamic change of task execution parameters (frequency, number of iterations, callback function)
 5. Power saving via entering IDLE sleep mode between tasks are scheduled to run
 6. Task invocation via Status Request object
 7. Task IDs and Control Points for error handling and watchdog timer
 8. Local Task Storage pointer (allowing use of same callback code for multiple tasks)
 9. Layered task prioritization
10. Support for std::functions (tested on ESPx only)
11. Overall task timeout
12. Static and dynamic callback method binding
13. CPU load / idle statistics for time critical applications

Scheduling overhead: between 15 and 18 microseconds per scheduling pass (check the benchmark example).

Tested on the following microcontrollers:
 - Arduino Uno R3
 - Arduino Nano
 - Arduino Micro
 - ATtiny85
 - ESP8266 (Node MCU v2.0)
 - ESP32
 - Teensy (tested on Teensy 3.5)
 - STM32F1 (tested on Mini USB STM32F103RCBT6 ARM Cortex-M3 leaflabs Leaf maple mini module F)
 - MSP430 and MSP432 boards

         "So after some digging I found TaskScheduler an awesome little library developed by Anatoli Arkhipenko,
          his github is here and the documentation is here. Its fantastic, so far I’ve been able to replicate
          some things I’ve seen in Ardupilot. ..."
