test_fonts folder contains various fonts found on the internet that appeared to be in the correct format. These were tested and found that they do appear to work. However I no longer have links to where these were found, or other information (other then what is in the header files). Most don't have a good name (IE: font8x8, or font6x8a, fixedwidthfont, ect). There are some fonts that at least under initial tests look like they may work
or at least partital work for both the small/medium and the large/normal settings. (Which would be nice if true).
Look at the header files for more information, they can be used all of the font "names" are "testfont" which of course can be changed as needed.
